# Getting Started with Create React App

Problem Statement:
1. Create a project using AngularJS/JQuery/Android/iOS/Ionic/React or other front-end
technologies.
2. Create a single page HTML/Native/Forms page to display reviews on a specific
product_id
3. User should be able to choose among product_ids 1 to 20, and viewer_ids 1 to 10 (what
if the user doesn’t know what product ids are there?)
4. Create an AJAX/Async call to display reviews from URL routes
“BASE_URL/reviews/&lt;product_id&gt;/&lt;viewer_id&gt;” (e.g. product_id = 20, viewer_id = 4)
5. Display the reviews with pagination (3 at a time)
6. By default show title, comment, usefulness, reviewer name (only if friend = true) and
Overall ratings.
7. Keep a button to show more, then display all the other ratings (e.g. delivery_time)
8. Use stars to display ratings
9. For bonus points and if you are interested (would be great if you don’t use a ready-made
plugin),
a. Provide sorting by rating.Overall (highest to lowest)
b. Provide sorting by reviewer.connection_level
c. Provide sorting by usefulness
